PyBank
Revenue

In this Challenge, my task is to create Python script to analyse the financial records of the company. To analyse I imported the the file budget_data.csv. The dataset was composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Further steps are as follows:

Calculating the total number of months included in the dataset

Caculating net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Determining changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

finding the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire periodand greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)
